Snowboarding/skateboarding- have been huge parts of my life since I was about 8 years old. Although I don't do them as much as I would like anymore, they are still a huge part of me.
Hiking/Camping- Another huge part of my life especially with my family, medicine for the soul.
Motorcycles- One last thing I have been doing for the past 20 years and something that also feeds my soul.
