Man this is a hard one, I have done lots of traveling throughout my life to include South and Central America, The Middle East, Europe and Canada.
British Columbia- Was certainly spectacular and somewhere I could spend the rest of my days, where the mountains meet the ocean it is a special place.
Israel- Holds a very special place in my heart. From Tel Aviv to the wailing wall and all of Jerusalem, it is another special place.
OBX- Last but certainly not least in my early childhood I was blessed enough to be able to go to Outer Banks, NC every summer for about two weeks. Some of my fondest memories of my family specifically my grandparents were had here.
